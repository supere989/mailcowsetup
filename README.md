## Project Overview
Implementation of Mailcow mail server with Tailscale integration, maintaining existing mail flow through Vultr server while providing web access via Tailscale Funnel.

## Documentation Organization
This repository contains the following documentation files:
- `README.md`: Main project documentation and progress tracking
- `process.md`: Detailed implementation procedures

## Architecture
```
Mail Flow:
Incoming: Internet → Vultr (Port 25) → Tailscale → Mailcow
Outgoing: Mailcow → Tailscale → Vultr → Gmail Relay → Internet

Web Access:
Users → Tailscale Funnel → Mailcow Web Interface (HTTPS)
```
